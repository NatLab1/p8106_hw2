###(a) Create scatter plots of response vs. predictors using the function featurePlot().

###(b) Perform polynomial regression to predict compressive strength using water as the
predictor. For 1 ≤ d ≤ 4, use cross-validation to select the optimal degree d for
the polynomial. What degree was chosen, and how does this compare to the results
of hypothesis testing using ANOVA? Make a plot of different polynomial fits to the
data.

###(c) Fit a smoothing spline using water as the predictor for a range of degrees of
freedom, as well as the degree of freedom obtained by generalized cross-validation,
and plot the resulting fits. Describe the results obtained.

###(d) Fit a GAM using all the predictors. Plot the results and explain your findings.
